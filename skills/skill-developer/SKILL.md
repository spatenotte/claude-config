description: Create and manage Claude Code skills following Anthropic best practices. Use when creating new skills, modifying skill-rules.json, understanding trigger patterns, working with hooks, debugging skill activation, or implementing progressive disclosure. Covers skill structure, YAML frontmatter, trigger types (keywords, intent patterns, file paths, content patterns), enforcement levels (block, suggest, warn), hook mechanisms (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse), session tracking, and the 500-line rule.

# Skill Developer Guide

## Purpose

Comprehensive guide for creating and managing skills in Claude Code with auto-activation system, following Anthropic's official best practices including the 500-line rule and progressive disclosure pattern.

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activates when you mention:
- Creating or adding skills
- Modifying skill triggers or rules
- Understanding how skill activation works
- Debugging skill activation issues
- Working with skill-rules.json
- Hook system mechanics
- Claude Code best practices
- Progressive disclosure
- YAML frontmatter
- 500-line rule

---

## System Overview

### Two-Hook Architecture

**1. UserPromptSubmit Hook** (Proactive Suggestions)
- **Trigger**: BEFORE Claude sees user's prompt
- **Purpose**: Suggest relevant skills based on keywords + intent patterns
- **Method**: Injects formatted reminder as context (stdout -> Claude's input)
- **Use Cases**: Topic-based skills, implicit work detection

**2. Stop Hook - Error Handling Reminder** (Gentle Reminders)
- **Trigger**: AFTER Claude finishes responding
- **Purpose**: Gentle reminder to self-assess error handling in code written
- **Method**: Analyzes edited files for risky patterns, displays reminder if needed
- **Use Cases**: Error handling awareness without blocking friction

### Configuration File

**Location**: `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json`

Defines:
- All skills and their trigger conditions
- Enforcement levels (block, suggest, warn)
- File path patterns (glob)
- Content detection patterns (regex)
- Skip conditions (session tracking, file markers, env vars)

## Skill Types

### 1. Guardrail Skills

**Purpose:** Enforce critical best practices that prevent errors

**Characteristics:**
- Type: `"guardrail"`
- Enforcement: `"block"`
- Priority: `"critical"` or `"high"`
- Block file edits until skill used
- Prevent common mistakes

**When to Use:**
- Mistakes that cause runtime errors
- Data integrity concerns
- Critical compatibility issues

### 2. Domain Skills

**Purpose:** Provide comprehensive guidance for specific areas

**Characteristics:**
- Type: `"domain"`
- Enforcement: `"suggest"`
- Priority: `"high"` or `"medium"`
- Advisory, not mandatory
- Topic or domain-specific

**When to Use:**
- Complex systems requiring deep knowledge
- Best practices documentation
- Architectural patterns
- How-to guides

## Quick Start: Creating a New Skill

### Step 1: Create Skill File

**Location:** `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

**Template:**
```markdown
---
name: my-new-skill
description: Brief description including keywords that trigger this skill. Mention topics, file types, and use cases. Be explicit about trigger terms.
---

# My New Skill

## Purpose
What this skill helps with

## When to Use
Specific scenarios and conditions

## Key Information
The actual guidance, documentation, patterns, examples
```

**Best Practices:**
- **Name**: Lowercase, hyphens, gerund form (verb + -ing) preferred
- **Description**: Include ALL trigger keywords/phrases (max 1024 chars)
- **Content**: Under 500 lines - use reference files for details
- **Examples**: Real code examples
- **Structure**: Clear headings, lists, code blocks

### Step 2: Add to skill-rules.json

See [SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md](references/SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md) for complete schema.

**Basic Template:**
```json
{
  "my-new-skill": {
    "type": "domain",
    "enforcement": "suggest",
    "priority": "medium",
    "promptTriggers": {
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "intentPatterns": ["(create|add).*?something"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test Triggers

**Test UserPromptSubmit:**
```bash
echo '{"session_id":"test","prompt":"your test prompt"}' | \
  npx tsx .claude/hooks/skill-activation-prompt.ts
```

**Test PreToolUse:**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | npx tsx .claude/hooks/skill-verification-guard.ts
{"session_id":"test","tool_name":"Edit","tool_input":{"file_path":"test.ts"}}
EOF
```

### Step 4: Refine Patterns

Based on testing:
- Add missing keywords
- Refine intent patterns to reduce false positives
- Adjust file path patterns
- Test content patterns against actual files

### Step 5: Follow Anthropic Best Practices

- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Use progressive disclosure with reference files
- Add table of contents to reference files > 100 lines
- Write detailed description with trigger keywords
- Test with 3+ real scenarios before documenting
- Iterate based on actual usage

---

## Enforcement Levels

### BLOCK (Critical Guardrails)

- Physically prevents Edit/Write tool execution
- Exit code 2 from hook, stderr -> Claude
- Claude sees message and must use skill to proceed
- **Use For**: Critical mistakes, data integrity, security issues

### SUGGEST (Recommended)

- Reminder injected before Claude sees prompt
- Claude is aware of relevant skills
- Not enforced, just advisory
- **Use For**: Domain guidance, best practices, how-to guides

### WARN (Optional)

- Low priority suggestions
- Advisory only, minimal enforcement
- **Use For**: Nice-to-have suggestions, informational reminders

---

## Skip Conditions & User Control

### 1. Session Tracking

- First edit -> Hook blocks, updates session state
- Second edit (same session) -> Hook allows
- Different session -> Blocks again

**State File:** `.claude/hooks/state/skills-used-{session_id}.json`

### 2. File Markers

**Marker:** `// @skip-validation`

Use sparingly - defeats the purpose if overused.

### 3. Environment Variables

```bash
export SKIP_SKILL_GUARDRAILS=true  # Disables ALL PreToolUse blocks
```
